The Niko Collection is a mod with little standardization that seeks to explore various types of fun throughout the multiverse!

If you've ever wanted to:

	-Meet a certain familiar feline
	-Hunt down a flying calculator for loot
	-Upgrade your crew into their ultimate forms
	-Have the thickest rocks this side of Node 17 (and beyond)
	-Shift your crew between specialized forms
	-Or just set everything on fire
	
Then look no further, because The Niko Collection offers all of that, and more!

Special thanks to:

		-Skye, for sprite work, various ships, and planning 
		-DemonFusionGamer, for coding  
		-Julk, for Niko miniships
		-R4, for sprite work and various flats
		-Vertaalfout, for coding and the Svarog
		-Shifting Walls, for wild ideas and writing
		-The Ghost Hugger, for encouragement and Python help
		-All of the Nikos who helped out along the way

For making this all possible!
